Blog site

I am using node.js in back-end,
MonogoDB as database,
HTML,CSS,JavaScript in front-end.

I have created 4 routes.

1) Index route which will show you all the blogs written.

2) New route which will show you a form to create a new blog.

3) Create route which acts as a POST route which will save the content in database.

4) show route to see a particular blog.

So, We will write the blog and it will get saved in database and will be shown on the home page.

At home page we will show all the blogs that are present in database.

At show page we will show that particular blog.
